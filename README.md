## Overview
This dashboard displays stocks that are likely to get removed from the S&P 500 due to a lowering of market capitalization, as well as all stocks that qualify to be added to the index. It is a common strategy among hedge funds to predict what stocks are likely to be added or subtracted in order to place trades around those stocks. In recent years has not been as fruitful as it once was.

## Methodlogy 
The decision to remove a stock from the index is made by a committee. So while it is a rule that stocks have to meet a threshold to be added, stocks that are already in the S&P 500 that fall below the threshold do not get automatically removed.

## What This Is Not
There are other reasons that stocks can get removed from the S&P, usually mergers. This does not even attempt to predict that. Also, just because a stock falls below the S&P's minimum capitalization mark, does not automatically mean the committee will remove it from the index. It's an art and a science. One thing is for certain, the committee watches it closely to look for signs of weakness. 

In the future, I would like to do an in-depth study of the history of companies that have been removed from the S&P for market capitalization reasons to possibly make this more accurate. 

## Notes
An index is just a basket of stocks, it does not become investable until a financial product is created that tracks the index.
