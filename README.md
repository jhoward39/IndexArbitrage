## Overview
This dashboard displays stocks that are likely to get removed from the S&P 500 due to a lowering of market capitalization, as well as all stocks that qualify to be added to the index. It is a common strategy among hedge funds to predict what stocks are likely to be added or subtracted in order to place trades around those stocks. In recent years this strategy has not been as fruitful as it once was. 


## Methodology 
The methodology behind this strategy is that if a stock is removed from S&P 500 the selling of shares by the many funds that track the index moves the price down. If a stock is added, the buy orders that many funds have to make raise the price significantly. The decision to add or remove a stock from the index is made by a committee. This committee is employed by the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. 

This is the committee's most recent update to the criteria for entry into the S&P 500:<be>
>In consideration of overall market conditions, the Index Committee believes a minimum threshold of $14.6 billion for the S&P 500 is appropriate. These ranges are reviewed >quarterly and updated as needed to assure consistency with market conditions. A company meeting the unadjusted company market capitalization criteria must also have a >security level float-adjusted market capitalization that is at least 50% of the respective index's unadjusted company level minimum market capitalization threshold.

>As a reminder, the market capitalization eligibility criteria are for addition to an index, not for continued membership. As a result, an index constituent that appears to >violate criteria for addition to that index is not removed unless ongoing conditions warrant an index change.

## What This Is Not
There are other reasons that stocks can get removed from the S&P, usually mergers. This does not even attempt to predict that. Also, just because a stock falls below the S&P's minimum capitalization mark, does not automatically mean the committee will remove it from the index. It's an art, not a science. One thing is for certain, the committee watches it closely to look for signs of weakness. 

In the future, I would like to do an in-depth study of the history of companies that have been removed from the S&P for market capitalization reasons to possibly predict closer to when the index is likely to drop a stock. 

## Notes
An index is just a basket of stocks, it does not become investable until a financial product is created that tracks the index.
There is no wikipedia page for the S&P Total Market Index while there is one for every other index
It is harder than you'd think to get a complete, accurate, and up-to-date list of index constituents.
